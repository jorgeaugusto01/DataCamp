----------------------- SUPERVISED LEARNING -----------------------
Predictor variables/features and a target variable
Libraries: SciPy, TensorFlow, Keras

EDA (Exploratory data analysis)

PLOTS:
    - scatter_matrix

CLASSIFICATION:
    - k-NN
        - Looking at the ‘k’ closest labeled data points. taking a majority vote
        - Larger k = smoother decision boundary = less complex model
        - Smaller k = more complex model = can lead to overfi"ing
    - REGRESSION

REGULARIZED REGRESSION (Penalizing large coefficients):
    - RIDGE: Picking alpha here is similar to picking k in k-NN (Very high alpha: Can lead to underfi"ing)
    - LASSO: Can be used to select important features of a dataset.

CROSS-VALIDATION (fold CV)
    - Model performance is dependent on way the data is split
    - More folds = More computationally expensive

PERFORMANCE:
    - Accuracy:Fraction of correct predictions
