#Join stock DataFrames and calculate returns
#Our first step towards calculating modern portfolio theory (MPT) portfolios
# is to get daily and monthly returns. Eventually we're going to get the best portfolios
# of each month based on the Sharpe ratio. The easiest way to do this is to put all our stock
# prices into one DataFrame, then to resample them to the daily and monthly time frames.
# We need daily price changes to calculate volatility, which we will use as our measure of risk.

# Join 3 stock dataframes together
full_df = pd.concat([lng_df, spy_df, smlv_df], axis=1).dropna()

# Resample the full dataframe to monthly timeframe
monthly_df = full_df.resample('BMS').first()

# Calculate daily returns of stocks
returns_daily = full_df.pct_change()

# Calculate monthly returns of the stocks
returns_monthly = monthly_df.pct_change().dropna()
print(returns_monthly.tail())

#Calculate covariances for volatility
#In MPT, we quantify risk via volatility. The math for calculating portfolio
# volatility is complex, and it requires daily returns covariances.
# We'll now loop through each month in the returns_monthly DataFrame, and
# calculate the covariance of the daily returns.
#With pandas datetime indices, we can access the month and year with df.index.month
# and df.index.year. We'll use this to create a mask for returns_daily that gives us the daily
# returns for the current month and year in the loop. We then use the mask to subset the DataFrame like this: df[mask].
# This gets entries in the returns_daily DataFrame which are in the current month and year in each cycle of the loop.
# Finally, we'll use pandas' .cov() method to get the covariance of daily returns.
# Daily covariance of stocks (for each monthly period)

covariances = {}
for i in returns_monthly.____:
    rtd_idx = returns_daily.index

    # Mask daily returns for each month and year, and calculate covariance
    mask = (rtd_idx.month == i.month) & (rtd_idx.____ == i.____)

    # Use the mask to get daily returns for the current month and year of monthy returns index
    covariances[i] = returns_daily[____].cov()

print(covariances[i])


#Calculate portfolios
#We'll now generate portfolios to find each month's best one. numpy's random.random()
# generates random numbers from a uniform distribution, then we normalize them so they sum to 1 using the /= operator.
# We use these weights to calculate returns and volatility. Returns are sums of weights times individual returns.
# Volatility is more complex, and involves the covariances of the different stocks.
# Finally we'll store the values in dictionaries for later use, with months' dates as keys.
# In this case, we will only generate 10 portfolios for each date so the code will run faster,
# but in a real-world use-case you'd want to use more like 1000 to 5000 randomly-generated portfolios for a few stocks.

portfolio_returns, portfolio_volatility, portfolio_weights = {}, {}, {}

# Get portfolio performances at each month
for date in sorted(covariances.keys()):
    cov = covariances[date]
    for portfolio in range(10):
        weights = np.random.random(3)
        weights /= np.sum(weights)  # /= divides weights by their sum to normalize
        returns = np.dot(weights, returns_monthly.loc[date])
        volatility = np.sqrt(np.dot(weights.T, np.dot(cov, weights)))
        portfolio_returns.setdefault(date, []).append(returns)
        portfolio_volatility.setdefault(date, []).append(volatility)
        portfolio_weights.setdefault(date, []).append(weights)

print(portfolio_weights[date][0])

#Plot efficient frontier
#We can finally plot the results of our MPT portfolios, which shows the "efficient frontier".
# This is a plot of the volatility vs the returns. This can help us visualize our risk-return possibilities
# for portfolios. The upper left boundary of the points is the best we can do (highest return for a given risk), and that is the efficient frontier.
#To create this plot, we will use the latest date in our covariances dictionary which we created
# a few exercises ago. This has dates as keys, so we'll get the sorted keys using sorted() and .keys(),
# then get the last entry with Python indexing ([-1]). Lastly we'll use matplotlib to scatter variance vs
# returns and see the efficient frontier for the latest date in the data.

# Get latest date of available data
date = sorted(covariances.keys())[-1]

# Plot efficient frontier
# warning: this can take at least 10s for the plot to execute...

#Get best Sharpe ratios
#We need to find the "ideal" portfolios for each date so we can use them as targets for
# machine learning. We'll loop through each date in portfolio_returns, then loop through
# the portfolios we generated with portfolio_returns[date]. We'll then calculate the Sharpe ratio,
# which is the return divided by volatility (assuming a no-risk return of 0).
#We use enumerate() to loop through the returns for the current date (portfolio_returns[date]) and keep
# track of the index with i. Then we use the current date and current index to get the volatility of each portfolio
# with portfolio_volatility[date][i]. Finally, we get the index of the best Sharpe ratio for each date using np.argmax().
# We'll use this index to get the ideal portfolio weights soon.
# Empty dictionaries for sharpe ratios and best sharpe indexes by date

#Calculate EWMAs
#We will now work towards creating some features to be able to predict our ideal portfolios.
# We will simply use the price movement as a feature for now. To do this we will create a daily
# exponentially-weighted moving average (EWMA), then resample that to the monthly timeframe.
# Finally, we'll shift the monthly moving average of price one month in the future, so we can use
# it as a feature for predicting future portfolios.

# Calculate exponentially-weighted moving average of daily returns
ewma_daily = returns_daily.ewm(span=30).mean()

print(ewma_monthly.iloc[-1])

#Make features and targets
#To use machine learning to pick the best portfolio, we need to generate features and targets.
# Our features were just created in the last exercise â€“ the exponentially weighted moving averages
# of prices. Our targets will be the best portfolios we found from the highest Sharpe ratio.
# We will use pandas' .iterrows() method to get the index, value pairs for the ewma_monthly DataFrame.
# We'll set the current value of ewma_monthly in the loop to be our features.
# Then we'll use the index of the best Sharpe ratio (from max_sharpe_idxs)
# to get the best portfolio_weights for each month and set that as a target.
targets, features = [], []

# Create features from price history and targets as ideal portfolio

#Plot efficient frontier with best Sharpe ratio
#Let's now plot the efficient frontier again, but add a marker for the portfolio with the best Sharpe index.
# Visualizing our data is always a good idea to better understand it.
# Recall the efficient frontier is plotted in a scatter plot of portfolio volatility on the x-axis,
# and portfolio returns on the y-axis. We'll get the latest date we have in our data from covariances.keys(),
# although any of the portfolio_returns, etc, dictionaries could be used as well to get the date.
# Then we get volatilities and returns for the latest date we have from our portfolio_volatility and portfolio_returns.
# Finally we get the index of the portfolio with the best Sharpe index from max_sharpe_idxs[date],
# and plot everything with plt.scatter().

# Get most recent (current) returns and volatility

#Make predictions with a random forest
#In order to fit a machine learning model to predict ideal portfolios, we need to create
# train and test sets for evaluating performance. We will do this as we did in previous chapters,
# where we take our features and targets arrays, and split them based on a train_size we set.
# Often the train size may be around 70-90% of our data.
# We then fit our model (a random forest in this case) to the training data,
# and evaluate the R2 scores on train and test using .score() from our model.
# In this case, the hyperparameters have been set for you, but usually you'd want
# to do a search with ParameterGrid like we did in previous chapters.
# Make train and test features
train_size = int(0.85 * features.shape[0])

print(rfr.score(train_features, train_targets))
print(rfr.score(test_features, test_targets))

#Get predictions and first evaluation
#Now that we have a trained random forest model (rfr), we want to use it to get predictions
# on the test set. We do this to evaluate our model's performance â€“ at a basic level, is it doing as
# well or better than just buying the index, SPY? We'll use the typical sklearn .predict(features) method,
# then multiply our monthly returns by our portfolio predictions. We sum these up with np.sum()
# since this will have 3 rows for each month. Then we plot both the monthly returns from our predictions,
# as well as SPY and compare the two.

# Get predictions from model on train and test

plt.legend()
plt.show()

#Evaluate returns
#Let's now see how our portfolio selection would perform as compared with just
# investing in the SPY. We'll do this to see if our predictions are promising, despite the low R2 value.
# We will set a starting value for our investment of $1000, then loop through the returns from our predictions
# as well as from SPY. We'll use the monthly returns from our portfolio selection and SPY and apply them to our
# starting cash balance. From this we will get a month-by-month picture of how our investment is doing, and we
# can see how our predictions did overall vs the SPY. Next, we can plot our portfolio from our predictions and compare it to SPY.

# Calculate the effect of our portfolio selection on a hypothetical $1k investment
cash = 1000
algo_cash, spy_cash = [cash], [cash] # set equal starting cash amounts
for r in test_returns:

print('algo returns:', (algo_cash[-1] - algo_cash[0]) / algo_cash[0])
print('SPY returns:', (spy_cash[-1] - spy_cash[0]) / spy_cash[0])


#Plot returns
#Lastly, we'll plot the performance of our machine-learning-generated portfolio versus
# just holding the SPY. We can use this as an evaluation to see if our
# predictions are doing well or not.
# Since we already have algo_cash and spy_cash created, all we need to do is
# provide them to plt.plot() to display. We'll also set the label for the datasets with legend in plt.plot().
# Plot the algo_cash and spy_cash to compare overall returns
plt.plot(algo_cash, label='algo')
plt.plot(spy_cash, label='SPY')
plt.legend()  # show the legend
